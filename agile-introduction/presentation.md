Note:
Daily standup
What did you do yesterday thatâ€™s worth mentioning ? 
What will you do today ?
What is blocking you?
Or
What did you do yesterday to help the team to reach the sprint goal?
What will you do today to help the team to reach the sprint goal?
What is stopping you from helping the team to reach the sprint goal?

Note:
Invest doesn't mean should we do it, but does it apply to the following rules
- "I" ndependent (of all others)
- "N" egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- "V" aluable (or vertical)
- "E" stimable (to a good approximation)
- "S" mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
- "T" estable (in principle, even if there isn't a test for it yet)
